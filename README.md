## 📖 Introduction

Large language models are increasingly post-trained with reinforcement learning in verifiable domains such as code and math. Yet, current methods for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) learn only from a scalar outcome reward per attempt, creating a severe credit-assignment bottleneck. Many verifiable environments actually provide rich textual feedback, such as runtime errors or judge evaluations, that explain *why* an attempt failed. We formalize this setting as *Reinforcement Learning with Rich Feedback* (RLRF):

</p>

**We propose Self-Distilled Policy Optimization (SDPO)**, a reinforcement learning framework that augments on-policy optimization with self-distillation from the model’s own high-reward trajectories.

SDPO converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context.

## 📊 Main Results

### Learning without Rich Environment Feedback

When environment feedback is sparse or rule-based, standard reinforcement learning methods struggle to propagate learning signals efficiently. SDPO addresses this by reusing high-reward rollouts as implicit feedback, providing dense supervision even in the absence of rich environment feedback.

</p>

*Training progression of Olmo3-7B-Instruct on Chemistry. We report the average accuracy across 16 samples per question and a rolling average of response lengths over 5 steps. We report GRPO with the optimal hyperparameters for this model and task. We run each configuration for 3 seeds and report standard errors as shaded areas.*

</p>

***Comparison of SDPO and GRPO on reasoning-related benchmarks.** We report the highest achieved avg@16 within 1 hour and 5 hours of wall-clock training time, respectively.
Both SDPO and on-policy GRPO perform one gradient step per generation batch, while GRPO performs 4 off-policy mini batch steps. We select optimal hyperparameters for SDPO and baselines based on 5h accuracy. Each run is performed on a node with 4 NVIDIA GH200 GPUs. Together with initialization and validation, each run takes approximately 6 hours.*

### Learning with Rich Environment Feedback

In settings where environments provide structured or textual feedback, SDPO naturally incorporates this information into self-distillation. By conditioning future attempts on both successful demonstrations and feedback from failed attempts, SDPO achieves faster convergence and more stable training.

***SDPO with rich environment feedback.**
Left: SDPO benefits from denser credit assignment (logit > token > sequence-level) and consistently outperforms GRPO when rich feedback is available.
Right: The self-teacher improves throughout training, and the final student substantially surpasses the initial teacher. Error bars show variability across seeds.*

### Solving Hard Questions via Test-Time Self-Distillation

SDPO also enables **test-time self-distillation**. By generating multiple candidate solutions, identifying high-quality responses, and reusing them as demonstrations, the model can iteratively refine its outputs at inference time.  This leads to substantial gains on hard reasoning tasks without additional training.

***Test-time self-distillation on hard coding problems.**
SDPO solves questions that neither the base model nor multi-turn interaction can solve, achieving higher solution discovery rates across generation budgets.*

### Installation

#### Option 1: Docker (Recommended for HPC/GH200 Clusters)

For NVIDIA GH200 (aarch64) clusters with CUDA 13.1, we provide a pre-configured Dockerfile based on the NGC vLLM container.

# Export for cluster use (enroot/squashfs)
enroot import -x mount -o sdpo-gh200.sqsh podman://localhost/sdpo-gh200:latest
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Docker images use `requirements-gh200.txt` which contains pinned versions from `requirements-full.txt`, excluding packages pre-installed in the NGC vLLM container (torch, vllm, flash-attn, xformers, triton).

---

### Data Preparation

The data is already loaded and split into train and test sets in the `datasets` directory. You can proceed to **preprocessing** the data.

If you want to load and process the data yourself, you can run the following command:

#### Data Loading
The detailed instructions for loading the data are provided in `data/README.md`.

One example is provided below:
```bash
python data/load_dataset.py \
    --dataset_name Chemistry \
    --output_path datasets/sciknoweval/chemistry.json
```

To split the data into train and test sets, run the following command:
```bash
python data/split_tasks.py \
    --json_path datasets/sciknoweval/chemistry.json \
    --output_dir datasets/sciknoweval/chemistry \
    --test_ratio 0.1 \
    --seed 42
```

For `LiveCodeBenchv6` split the _unit tests_ into train and test sets, run the following command:
```bash
python data/split_tests.py \
    --json_path datasets/lcb_v6.json \
    --output_dir datasets/lcb_v6
```


#### Data Preprocessing
Our implementation uses the `parquet` format for the data. To preprocess the data, run the following command:

```bash
python data/preprocess.py \
    --data_source DATASET_PATH
```
`DATASET_PATH` should contain the `train.json` and `test.json` files.

---

### Configuration
Before running experiments, adapt the paths in `verl/trainer/config/user.yaml` to your environment:

```yaml
vars:
  dir: /path/to/your/SDPO              # Path to the SDPO repository
  log_dir: /path/to/your/logs          # Directory for logs
  ckpt_dir: /path/to/your/checkpoints  # Directory for model checkpoints
```

---

### Training

#### Reproducing Results (Without Rich Environment Feedback)

Run the following commands to reproduce the results without rich environment feedback.

**GRPO baseline:**
```bash
bash experiments/generalization/run_baseline_grpo_all.sh
```

**SDPO:**
```bash
bash experiments/generalization/run_sdpo_all.sh
```

#### Reproducing Results (With Rich Environment Feedback)
Run the following commands to reproduce the results with rich environment feedback.

**GRPO baseline:**
```bash
bash experiments/rich_feedback/run_baseline_grpo.sh
```

**SDPO:**
```bash
bash experiments/rich_feedback/run_sdpo.sh
```

---

### Multi-turn Baseline of Section 5

Prepare the data by splitting it into individual tasks:

```
export MY_DATA_SPLITS_DIR=lcb_v6
export MY_DATA_SINGLES_DIR=lcb_v6_singles
bash dat/prepare_data_splits.sh datasets/lcb_v6.json
```

Run the multi-turn baseline for, e.g., question 120:

```
python baseline_multiturn/multiturn.py --data-dir=lcb_v6_singles/q_120 --run-name multiturn_q120
```

Or, for all hard questions:

```
bash experiments/ttt/run_multiturn_all.sh
```
